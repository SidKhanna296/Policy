Below is ideal recommendation 

But if something is needed from me or _**more importantly you just want to chit-chat**_ always feel free to send a message my way 😁 !! It don't matter if I am on DnD or not!

# Meetings:
Ideally: 
- 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM
- 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM

# PR Reviews
- If something needs my input and review feel free to send the PR my way, I normally review PRs during my meeting hours
- If something generalistic: Post the PR in the teams channel for the given asset!


# Questions and Help
- More likely then not if you're reaching out to me you've got questions that need my input - since only a Subject Matter Expert can answer these question - Please send it my way 🙂 !!

- But if you got questions regarding certain assets and how they work or anything generalistic, feel free to post it in the associated teams channel or group chats!
